# Web Application

As KGraph Nexus uses a Web Browser view as its interface, its possible to use this directly as a web interface without the surrounding Desktop Application.

In the development plan, once the Desktop Application is at a stable release, a web version will be released as well which will have two KGraph Nexus implementations for data access: 1) a self hosted KGraph Nexus REST API and 2) a KGraph Nexus Managed Service available from Vital.ai.  The Managed Service will be part the Vital Agent Ecosystem Managed Service.
